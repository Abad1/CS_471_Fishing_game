# CS_471_Fishing_game
How to play:
Move the hook up and down with the mouse.

Touch fish with the hook to catch them, and bring them out of the water to score points.

Avoid the barrels that float by. If they touch the hook, then bait is lost, and if a fish is on the hook, the fish is also lost.

If a barrel is touched when you have no bait, then it's game over.
